# attack-on-agent
A MITRE Caldera plugin used to do a spanning of abilities on various agents (without using the API's).
It is a simplified version of another plugin used in a private repo.

Instructions are very simple:
1) Add the plugin name to the list that you can find in /caldera/conf/local.yml (or 'default.yml' if you don't have this one)
2) Run Caldera from main directory with: `python3 server.py --fresh`

Work in progress...
